OFFICIAL APTIS RUBRIC FOR PART 1:
Maximum Score: ${maxScore} points (CEFR-based conversion)

CEFR SCALE (0-5 internal rubric, will be converted to ${maxScore} points):
5 = B1 or above: Likely to be above A2 level
4 = A2.2: All three questions answered on-topic with:
  • Some simple grammatical structures used correctly, basic mistakes systematically occur
  • Vocabulary sufficient to respond, inappropriate lexical choices noticeable
  • Mispronunciations noticeable and frequently strain listener
  • Frequent pausing, false starts, reformulations but meaning clear

3 = A2.1: Two questions answered on-topic with same features as A2.2

2 = A1.2: At least two questions on-topic with:
  • Grammatical structure limited to words and phrases
  • Errors in basic patterns impede understanding
  • Vocabulary limited to very basic personal information words
  • Pronunciation mostly unintelligible except isolated words
  • Frequent pausing, false starts impede understanding

1 = A1.1: One question on-topic with same features as A1.2

0 = A0: No meaningful language or completely off-topic (memorised script, guessing)

ASSESSMENT AREAS:
- Task fulfilment / topic relevance
- Grammatical range and accuracy
- Vocabulary range and accuracy
- Pronunciation
- Fluency

QUESTION: ${question.content}

STUDENT'S TRANSCRIBED SPEECH: ${answerText}

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
- First, assess the CEFR level (A0, A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, A2.2, or B1+) based on APTIS rubric above
- Then, convert CEFR to numerical score using this mapping for ${maxScore} max points:
  * A0 = 0 points
  * A1.1 = ${(maxScore * 0.2).toFixed(2)} points (20% of max)
  * A1.2 = ${(maxScore * 0.4).toFixed(2)} points (40% of max)
  * A2.1 = ${(maxScore * 0.6).toFixed(2)} points (60% of max)
  * A2.2 = ${(maxScore * 0.8).toFixed(2)} points (80% of max)
  * B1+ = ${maxScore} points (100% of max)
- Consider: How many questions answered on-topic? Quality of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, fluency
- Be strict: A2.2 requires ALL THREE questions answered well

CRITICAL ASSESSMENT NOTES:
- Part 4 gives 1 minute preparation, expects 2 minutes continuous speech
- Must answer ALL THREE abstract questions in one structured response
- First, assess the CEFR level (A1/A2, B1.1, B1.2, B2.1, B2.2, C1, or C2) based on APTIS rubric
- Then, convert CEFR to numerical score using this mapping for ${maxScore} max points:
  * A1/A2 = 0 points
  * B1.1 = ${(maxScore * 0.17).toFixed(2)} points (≈17% of max, 1/6 scale)
  * B1.2 = ${(maxScore * 0.33).toFixed(2)} points (≈33% of max, 2/6 scale)
  * B2.1 = ${(maxScore * 0.50).toFixed(2)} points (50% of max, 3/6 scale)
  * B2.2 = ${(maxScore * 0.67).toFixed(2)} points (≈67% of max, 4/6 scale)
  * C1 = ${(maxScore * 0.83).toFixed(2)} points (≈83% of max, 5/6 scale)
  * C2 = ${maxScore} points (100% of max, 6/6 scale)
- Did student answer ALL THREE questions? Or describe photo (wrong)?
- Is speech well-structured with clear flow? Or just listing points?
- Assess complexity: Simple grammar only → B1, Complex grammar → B2+
- Assess cohesion: Simple connectors (and, but) → B1, Range of devices (however, moreover, consequently) → B2+
